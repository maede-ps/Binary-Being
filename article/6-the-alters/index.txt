8:T6a2,<p><strong>The Alters</strong> is not just a game; it is a deep journey into the human psyche. It tells the story of an engineer named <strong>Jan Dolski</strong>, stranded alone on a hostile planet, who must create alternate versions of himself—each shaped by different past decisions and personalities—in order to survive.</p>
<h2>The Story Behind the Game</h2>
<p>Jan Dolski is the sole survivor of a failed space mission. Trapped on a dangerous planet with a lethal sun, he constructs a rotating base to stay out of its deadly light. However, maintaining and expanding the base requires help.</p>
<p>To do so, Jan creates <em>Alters</em>—clones that represent different life paths he could have taken. Each Alter possesses unique skills, perspectives, and emotional traits, leading to both cooperation and conflict.</p>
<h2>Gameplay and Mechanics</h2>
<p><em>The Alters</em> combines resource management, base building, and time-sensitive survival mechanics. Every decision carries weight, as players must balance efficiency, interpersonal tensions between Alters, and the constant threat posed by the planet’s environment.</p>
<p>Managing relationships is just as important as managing resources, making psychological strategy a core gameplay element.</p>
<h2>Meet the Creative Minds</h2>
<p>The game’s narrative is crafted by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Magda Gamrot</strong> — Lead Writer</li>
<li><strong>Katarzyna Tybinka</strong> — Senior Writer</li>
<li><strong>Tomasz Kisilewicz</strong> — Game Director</li>
</ul>
<p>Their shared vision was to create a deeply human experience centered on choice, identity, and the lives we might have lived if we had chosen differently.</p>
