Containers have fundamentally changed how we think about software deployment. Docker didn't just solve the "it works on my machine" problem—it created an entirely new paradigm for building, shipping, and running applications at scale.

## The Container Revolution
Containers package applications with all their dependencies, creating a consistent runtime environment that works the same way across development, testing, and production. This consistency eliminates the "works on my machine" problem and makes deployments predictable and reliable.

## Beyond Docker: The Ecosystem
The container ecosystem now includes orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, service meshes like Istio, and countless tools for monitoring, security, and management.
