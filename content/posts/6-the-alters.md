**The Alters** is not just a game; it is a deep journey into the human psyche. It tells the story of an engineer named **Jan Dolski**, stranded alone on a hostile planet, who must create alternate versions of himself—each shaped by different past decisions and personalities—in order to survive.

## The Story Behind the Game

Jan Dolski is the sole survivor of a failed space mission. Trapped on a dangerous planet with a lethal sun, he constructs a rotating base to stay out of its deadly light. However, maintaining and expanding the base requires help.

To do so, Jan creates *Alters*—clones that represent different life paths he could have taken. Each Alter possesses unique skills, perspectives, and emotional traits, leading to both cooperation and conflict.

## Gameplay and Mechanics

*The Alters* combines resource management, base building, and time-sensitive survival mechanics. Every decision carries weight, as players must balance efficiency, interpersonal tensions between Alters, and the constant threat posed by the planet’s environment.

Managing relationships is just as important as managing resources, making psychological strategy a core gameplay element.

## Meet the Creative Minds

The game’s narrative is crafted by:

- **Magda Gamrot** — Lead Writer  
- **Katarzyna Tybinka** — Senior Writer  
- **Tomasz Kisilewicz** — Game Director  

Their shared vision was to create a deeply human experience centered on choice, identity, and the lives we might have lived if we had chosen differently.
