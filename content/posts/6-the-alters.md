<p><strong>The Alters</strong> is not just a game; it's a deep journey into the human psyche. It tells the story of an engineer named <strong>Jan Dolski</strong>, stranded alone on a harsh planet, who must create alternate versions of himself — each with different pasts and personalities — to survive.</p>

<h3>The Story Behind the Game</h3>
<p>Jan Dolski is the sole survivor of a failed space mission. On a hostile planet with a deadly sun, he builds a rotating base to escape the harsh light. But to maintain and develop the base, he must create <em>Alters</em> — clones representing different possible life paths he could have taken, each with unique skills and personalities.</p>

<h3>Gameplay and Mechanics</h3>
<p>The Alters features resource management, base-building, and time-sensitive survival mechanics where every decision matters. You must balance the needs and conflicts of your Alters while racing against time and the planet's dangers.</p>

<h3>Meet the Creative Minds</h3>
<p>The game’s narrative was crafted by <strong>Magda Gamrot</strong> (Lead Writer), <strong>Katarzyna Tybinka</strong> (Senior Writer), and <strong>Tomasz Kisilewicz</strong> (Game Director). Their goal was to create a human experience about choices, identity, and the lives we might have lived.</p>
