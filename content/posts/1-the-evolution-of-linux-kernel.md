<p>What started as a hobby project by a Finnish computer science student has become the backbone of modern computing. The Linux kernel, first released in 1991, now powers everything from smartphones to supercomputers, embodying the true spirit of open-source collaboration.</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds never imagined that his simple announcement on a Usenet newsgroup would spark a revolution that would challenge the dominance of proprietary operating systems and create the foundation for the modern internet.</p>

<h3>The Birth of a Revolution</h3>
<p>In August 1991, a 21-year-old computer science student posted a message that would change the world: "I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones."</p>

<p>Little did Linus know that this "hobby" would grow into the most successful collaborative software project in history, powering billions of devices and enabling the digital transformation of our world.</p>

<h3>Technical Excellence Through Collaboration</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel's success lies in its unique development model. Unlike proprietary systems developed behind closed doors, Linux benefits from the scrutiny of thousands of developers worldwide. Every patch, every line of code is reviewed, tested, and refined by a global community of experts.</p>

<h3>From Servers to Smartphones</h3>
<p>Today, Linux runs on everything from the smallest embedded systems to the world's most powerful supercomputers. Android, based on the Linux kernel, powers over 2 billion smartphones. The vast majority of web servers, cloud infrastructure, and IoT devices rely on Linux.</p>

<p>Understanding Linux isn't just about learning an operating system—it's about understanding the foundation of modern computing and the power of open-source collaboration.</p>
